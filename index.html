                <h1>My Tech Journey</h1>
                <p>Growing up, I have always been passionate about creating anything i can, a paper toy car,a fan with the use of rator, torchlight to brigthing our
                    household at night. Basically anything that i can think of,i build it. Most of what i build use electricity so i decided to become an electronic 
                    engineer so i can build a device that will change the world one day. Getting to Lautech, i made a lot of friend including guys that is learning programming in SQI college of technology beside Lautech Campus. Watching 
                    those guys code made me realise something "I don't need to be an electronic engineer before i can build stuff,i can also build Website that can help people while learning electronic engineer".
                    On getting home after the semester,i convince my daddy to get me a laptop which he did. That was how i started my tech journey
                </p>
                <p>
                    After getting the laptop, i started learning HTML and CSS from Youtube and within one and half months, I am already building webpages on my own. I try learning JavaScript from Youtube but it was not
                    as understanding as HTML and CSS. During my struggle with JavaScript, my friends from SQI College introduce Angela Yu's Web Development Udemy Course to me. Since the course has everything i need to learn about
                    web development, i enrolled and learn JavaScript,Bootstrap,node.js,React,jQuery and everything the course have to offer. Right now, i am in my building project phase.
